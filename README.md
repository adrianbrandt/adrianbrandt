Welcome to my github page where i post most of my projects!

This site is a work in progress, where i have deleted alot of Repositories that i am no longer wokring on.
I am planning on posting more work from my studies, and some private time projects i have made during my code sessions.

Feel free to use my work in any situation. Would appreciate if i was included or tagged in projects my work is used in so i can see how my code is being used!
PS! Repositories tagged with "-Assignement" is tasks where my school has posted some code and the assignement wanted us to find workarounds.
With this said i cannot take credit for all the work done in the marked Repositories.
